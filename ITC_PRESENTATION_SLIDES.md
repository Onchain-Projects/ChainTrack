# SLIDE 2: The Problem

**Headline:** ₹22,000+ Crore Annual Loss from Illicit Cigarettes

# SLIDE 3: ITC's Current Supply Chain

**Headline:** Where Counterfeits Infiltrate

```
🌿 TOBACCO FARMS → 🏭 PROCESSING → 🏭 MANUFACTURING → 🚚 C&F AGENTS → 🏪 DISTRIBUTORS → 🏬 RETAILERS → 👤 CONSUMERS
                                                              ↑                    ↑              ↑
                                                         [COUNTERFEIT ENTRY POINTS - NO VERIFICATION]
```

### Current Challenges:
| Stage | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Manufacturing | Batch tracking is paper-based |
| Distribution | 6,000+ distributors with no real-time visibility |
| Retail | 3.8M outlets - counterfeits enter undetected |
| Consumer | No way to verify authenticity |
